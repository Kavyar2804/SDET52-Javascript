<!-- DOM is generated by the browser when it parses HTML and XML documents. 
The browser creates a tree-like structure in memory, and then uses the DOM to access and manipulate the elements of the tree. 
The DOM can be used to add, modify, or delete elements and their content, as well as to respond to user events. -->
<!-- in JavaScript, the DOM is accessible via the document object, which serves as the entry point to the document tree. -->
